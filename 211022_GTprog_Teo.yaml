what: |
  PR of the Month: Architecture of a GitHub bot, the trigger-action model


  In the context of the development of the Coq proof assistant, I have
  created and maintained a multi-function bot to assist developers in
  automating some basic and repetitive tasks. In this talk, I will
  present a recent pull request that was submitted to the bot
  repository and this will be an opportunity to present the way the
  bot is architectured, and how it uses a modern, typed, GitHub API
  and suitable OCaml libraries to implement its features, and how that
  makes it easy to extend.
