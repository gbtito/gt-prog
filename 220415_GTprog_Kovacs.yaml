what: |
  A first-principles investigation of performance of elaboration with dependent types

  In practice, the popular proof assistants based on type theory (Coq, Agda, Lean) all require users to navigate around performance issues and bottlenecks in sufficiently large or complex codebases. I hypothesize some common performance issues and try to address them in a minimal implementation, called "smalltt".

  One goal is to have a concrete data point for what kind of performance is achievable in the presence of the basic convenience features of pattern unification and implicit arguments. Another goal is to develop general solutions which plausibly scale to production-strength systems without losing too much performance, and also allow fine-tuning based on more realistic codebases.
